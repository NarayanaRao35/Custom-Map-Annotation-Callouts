This project was taken from this address: http://blog.asolutions.com/2010/09/building-custom-map-annotation-callouts-part-1/

Unfortunately, this blog seems to be offline. Since the code was pretty helpful to me, I decided to upload it again over here. You'll also find a pdf with the original post.

I have no relation with asolutions.com whatsoever and the code is provided as it was in the original post. I do not intend to break any copyright.
